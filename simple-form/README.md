# Simple Form

This project is a quick, simple form I created during my internship at Swampfox Technologies to initiate a call for a sales demo. The project was created in Angular and styled with Bootstrap, making it reactive for mobile devices. With the correct authorizations, this form will signal an api call to initiate a phone call with the inputted phone number.

## Run Code

Run `npm install` to build the project. Then, `ng serve --open` to create and open a development server.
