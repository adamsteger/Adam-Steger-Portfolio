# Adam-Steger-Portfolio
This repository contains public individual and group projects I have contributed to in the past few years. Build instructions and more details on my specific contributions can be found in the READMEs inside of the directories.

### LifesABit (Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL)
This directory contains the Gate Guard application on my resume. It is an electronic pass manager for gated communities, and it can be found [here](https://gate-guard.com/).  In this project, I used Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL for the backend of the application.  

### Computation (Java)
This directory contains coursework for Foundations in Computation.  My code features a program to remove epsilon transitions from an NFA, as well as a program to simulate a NFA for a given string input. 

### Internship (Java, JSON, JUnit)
This directory contains the group project UrTern, which is a console application where employees can create internship posts and students can build resumes and apply to internship posts.  This is a Java project in which I designed a JSON database to store the information for the posts, students, employers, etc.
