# UrTern

This is a console application made in CSCE 247: Software Engineering purposefully on a tight schedule, so not all functionality was finished. You can access the app as a student and edit your resume and browse/apply to internship posts, or you sign in as an employer and create internship posts and leave reviews on students.

### My Contributions
In this project, I designed the structure of the json files that serve as the database for our system.  Most of my contributions can be found in the DataLoader and DataWriter files.  As the project was very rushed by our professor, the code could use some refactoring, but does function as intended.

### Build Instructions
To run this project. First, clone the portfolio repository by running the following command in the terminal:

git clone https://github.com/adamsteger/Adam-Steger-Portfolio.git

Then, using your IDE's Java Run extension, run the main method in InternshipUI.java.
